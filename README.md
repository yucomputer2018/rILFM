# rILFM
A generative model for count-value networks with overlapping community structure and use the Indian buffet process to model the community assignment matrix $Z$; thus, provide a flexible nonparametric Bayesian scheme that can allow the number of communities $K$ to increase as more and more data are encountered instead of to be fixed in advance. An effective fully uncollapsed Gibbs sampler for the generative model has been derived. We conduct experiment on the LESMIS network. The LESMIS network is patchy at best. This network is included in the collection of Miscellaneous Networks, and describes the coappearance of characters in Les Miserables by Victor Hugocontain. The undirected weighted graph contains 77 nodes and 254 edges.
